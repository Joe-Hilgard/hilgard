#' Fuse cell means and pool SDs to turn a many cells into two cells
#'
#' Often you need to calculate an effect size from a 2Ã—2 (or more complex!) study design.
#' Use this function to combine the relevant cells into just two cells for entry into your spreadsheet.
#' @param m1 Vector of means to pool into Group 1
#' @param sd1 Vector of SDs to pool into Group 1
#' @param n1 Vector of cell ns to pool into Group 1
#' @param m2 Vector of means to pool into Group 2
#' @param sd2 Vector of SDs to pool into Group 2
#' @param n2 Vector of cell ns to pool into Group 2
